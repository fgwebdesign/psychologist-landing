        "answer": "Sessions last 50 minutes, but I allow flexibility to extend them to 55 minutes if needed. This is based on the traditional \"50-minute hour\" used in therapy, ensuring enough time for discussion while allowing preparation for the next session."

      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "Can I have a trial session before committing to therapy?",
        "answer": "Yes, I offer a 30-minute tryout session to help you determine if my approach is the right fit for you. This session allows you to ask questions and discuss your needs before committing to therapy."
