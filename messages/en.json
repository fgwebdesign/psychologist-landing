      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "Can I have a trial session before committing to therapy?",
        "answer": "Yes, I offer a 30-minute tryout session to help you determine if my approach is the right fit for you. This session allows you to ask questions and discuss your needs before committing to therapy."
